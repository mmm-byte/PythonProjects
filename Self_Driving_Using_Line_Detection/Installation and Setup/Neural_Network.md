# OpenCV Neural Network

Imagine a vehicle having the ability to sense its surroundings, navigate its way through traffic, and perform all transportation functions automatically. This vehicle is referred to as an autonomous or self-driving vehicle. Without any assistance from a person, autonomous vehicles may analyse their surroundings using camera, radar, lidar, GPS, and navigational pathways. Nobody today can dispute that self-driving cars are the technology of the future that will have a significant impact on people's lives. I believe that everyone is aware of Tesla, Google, and other businesses involved in the development of self-driving cars, including Tesla Model S, whose Autopilot handles highway driving, among many others. One of the primary functions of automated vehicles is to improve safety, lessen traffic accidents, and ultimately save lives. It appears that one of the automated cars' many intricate and difficult responsibilities is road lane detecting or road lane borders detection.
