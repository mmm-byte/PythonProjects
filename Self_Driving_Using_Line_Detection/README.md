# Self Driving Car using Line Detection
We're going to use a Raspberry Pi to construct a self-driving vehicle in this project that can recognise lanes. We will first quickly review the hardware aspect before writing the code in depth and writing it step by step. Instead of using a raspberry pi, we will develop the code on a desktop computer, then add it to the pi. This means that even if the Car isn't ready, you may still follow along to learn lane detection.

## Initial Setup
We're going to set up your Raspberry Pi quickly for the first time so you can start working on a straightforward project. We'll find out how to use Windows or Mac to remotely control a Raspberry Pi. To comprehend input and output devices, we will use an LED light and a push button.


## OpenCV Installation on RaspberryPi
Raspberry Pi Opencv installation. The python package manager pip can typically be used for this, although opencv on the Raspberry Pi frequently has installation issues with pip. As a result, we must install from the source. We will walk through each step needed to install opencv from source in this video.
